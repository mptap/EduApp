<h1>Compiling and Running with Arguments</h1>
This section is used for you to use Java at home and understand the basics of how things are done.

After creating a simple application that prints something to the screen, you need to compile your code an run it.
<br>
It shouldn't really matter if you use Linux, Mac or Windows. You need to have a console and you need to have the following commands available in order to compile and run Java.

<ul>

<li>java (or java.exe)</li>
<li>javac (or javac.exe)</li>

</ul>
In order for those to be available you must download and install JDK (Java Development Kit).
<br>
If we take the code from the previous lesson and put it in a file called MyFirstClass.java, in order to compile it we need to run:

<pre>javac MyFirstClass.java</pre>
This is create a file called MyFirstClass.class that holds the compiled java code.

To run it, we need to run java with the name of the class as the argument (Not the file!)

<b></b>Wrong</b>

<pre>java MyFirstClass.class</pre>
Right!

<pre>java MyFirstClass</pre>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
The main methods get an array of strings as an argument, these are the command line arguments you may pass to your program.

Every array in java holds a variable called length that says how many elements are within that array.

We can go over the arguments with a simple for

<pre>public class Arguments {
public static void main(String[] args) {
for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
System.out.println(args[i]);
}
}
}    </pre>
And o run it with arguments:

<pre>javac Arguments.java
java Arguments arg0 arg1 arg2</pre>  <br>      <br>
